This folder contains the stl files for printing a 3D case for the Zemo aquarium monitor.
## Notes:
* Test prints were done using the Cura Slicer to prepare gcode files and the Prusa Mk2S printer at 0.15 mm z height.
* The case is designed to be printed without supports, so adding them is optional.
* Tolerances are purposely tight to prevent wiggling after assembly. Sanding of the interfaces may be necessary.
